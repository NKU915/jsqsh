## Variable

  `maxlen` - The maximum display width of a column

## Description

  The `${maxlen}` variable determines the maximum width that any individual
  column may consume (the default is 35). Columns exceeding that width 
  will have their contents word-wrapped, if necessary, during display. This
  variable may not be utilized in all display styles (e.g. it is ignored
  by the `perfect` style).
