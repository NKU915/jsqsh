## Variable

  `show_meta` - Controls the display of result set metadata.

## Description
  The `${show_meta}` variable causes result set metadata (column names, 
  data types, etc.) to be displayed as a separate result set just before
  the actual row results. This feature is primarily intended as a debugging
  tool for jsqsh development and/or developers that want to diagnose 
  issues with result handling in their applications.
