## Variable

  `nocount` - Controls the display of "rows affected" due to updates and deletes

## Description

  The `${nocount}` variable can be used to suppress the output of:
   
    (XXX rows affected)
      
  that are generated by INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements (that is,
  statements that do not generate row results). 
   
  Note that some platforms allow these sorts of counts to be disabled at
  the server (e.g. Sybase's and Microsoft's `set nocount on` option). 
  This variable does NOT turn the setting off at the server, but simply
  hides the messages from display.
   
  The default value is `false`, indicating that these results should be
  displayed.
