## Variable

   `auto_pager` - Controls if certain jsqsh commands are automatically paged

## Description

   Certain jsqsh commands, such as `\help`, automatically send their output
   to a pager program, such as the `more` command, allowing you to page
   forward and backwards through the output of the command. The `${auto_pager}` 
   variable controls whether not auto-paging is enabled for these commands.
