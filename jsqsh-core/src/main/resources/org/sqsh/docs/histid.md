## Variable

  `histid` - The history id of the current buffer

## Description

  The read-only `${histid}` variable can be used to retrieve the history
  id of the current buffer.  That is, the number under which the current
  buffer will appear from `\history` after it is executed. This is particularly
  useful within the `${prompt}` variable.
