HEADER #1

  This is an example of our first
  markdown test input I am going to [1mjust[0m
  starting putting stuff in here to see
  if it works!

     How about a fancy code block?
     It'll look totally cool

  And here is another paragraph, that
  should also wrap, because wrapping is
  totally awesome

     * And how about a bullet, eh?
     * And [4manother[0m bullet? We'll also
       try to make sure there is enough
       here to make the line wrap a few
       times.

  And resuming the paragraphs, with some[0m
  [1m[1minline code[0m because that is cool
