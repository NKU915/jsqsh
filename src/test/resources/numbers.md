# Testing bulleted lists

In this test, I'll check that numbered lists work ok with a 
variety of layouts, indent depths, and nested code elements.

  1. This is sitting at level one
 1. This will be bumped up to land at level one as well
   though it is indented less than the previous one.
     1. And this is at level two
        1. And do I hear a level 3??
     99. And another one at level two
  2. And back to level 1

And back to a regular paragraph

  1. Let's test code blocks now
         this should not be a code block because it does not have
         a preceeding blank space.
  2. But, now I will have a code block.

        Here is my very first code block 
        in a numbered list
  
     text continuing the current numbered item
  3. And another numbered item
   
        With a closing
        Code block

And a closing paragraph

  1. A new number,
and some more that is part of the same number
    1. And a sub-number
## Header 2
And starting a new paragraph

  1. Numbers
  
  * With 
  
  3. Blank
  
  4. Lines
