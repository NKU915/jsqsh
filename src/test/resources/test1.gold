HEADER #1

  This is an example of our first
  markdown test input I am going to [1mjust[0m
  starting putting stuff in here to see
  if it works!

    How about a fancy code block?
    It'll look totally cool

  And here is another paragraph, that
  should also wrap, because wrapping is
  totally awesome

    * And how about a bullet, eh?
    * And [4manother[0m bullet? We'll also try
      to make sure there is enough here
      to make the line wrap a few times.

  And resuming the paragraphs, with some
  [1minline code [0mbecause that is cool
